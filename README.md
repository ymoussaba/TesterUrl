## Tester Url

Tester Url is a backend for testing when you don't one. It works with 5 simple steps:

* Generate your Url
* Copy the Url into your app
* Make a network request from that app
* Cut and paste in a response
* Watch that response go down to your app

## Live Example
Browse the live demo on [http://testerurl.com](http://testerurl.com). If I have time, video tutorials are on the way as well.

## Before You Begin

Tester Url is build on top of [MEAN.JS](https://github.com/meanjs/mean) so I recommend heading over there and making sure you are familiar with the MEAN stack and everything there.
