## Tester Url

Tester Url is a backend for testing when you don't one. It works with 5 simple steps:

* Generate your Url
* Copy the Url into your app
* Make a network request from that app
* Cut and paste in a response
* Watch that response go down to your app

## Live Example
Browse the live app on [http://testerurl.com](http://testerurl.com). For an iOS networking tutorial using Tester Url, check out [https://github.com/captainchung/iOS-Networking-Examples](https://github.com/captainchung/iOS-Networking-Examples)

## Before You Begin

Tester Url is build on top of [MEAN.JS](https://github.com/meanjs/mean) so I recommend heading over there and making sure you are familiar with the MEAN stack and everything there.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/captainchung/TesterUrl.git
cd TesterUrl
npm install
bower install
```

## Running Your Application

```
grunt
```

## Note

Not everything is being used. There are still some fragments from the MEAN.js scaffold which have not been refactored out.
